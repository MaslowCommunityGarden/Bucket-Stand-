# Bucket Stand 

Stand that holds a bucket or flower pot or anything else that is about 10.5 inches and tapered.

I originally made this hold a bucket with poultry water nipples in the bottom to water my chickens. Once it was made the Maslow community helped me see many other uses for it: 
* Bucket to hold your favorite libation on ice (beer, soda, water, you name it...)
* Flower pots
* Throw some small casters on it (now you got wheels baby!)
* Edit this page and add more!

The bucket came from the local super market bakery, it is a 3 gallon bucket that originally held frosting.
